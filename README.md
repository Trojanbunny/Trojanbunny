- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trojanbunny
- 👀 I am interested in getting into programing and getting skilled enough to help with projects and possibly make a career doing it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and React Native.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me grow as a programmer and help others while doing it.
